# Course Projects @ Olin

## Software Design (Spring 2022):
An computing elective at Olin, Software Design teaches the principles of various disciplines of software design and programming through the use of Python. I completed this course in Spring 2022.

### [Local Climate Change](https://olincollege.github.io/local-climate-change/)

We've noticed that the vast majority of global warming and climate change information in the media centers around either record-breaking disasters or complex scientific studies inaccessible to the average citizen. We decided to visualize weather data over time, not in the Arctic or the stratosphere, but from the same local weather stations that supply your weather app the current temperature when you wake up in the morning.

We decided to dig into data collected by the ***National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)***, more specifically their ***National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)***. By looking at these historical weather datasets from a wide variety of cities around the United States, we can begin to visualize the increase in global temperatures and ever-changing global climate.

Our hypothesis is that if humans can see the data behind their anecdotal observations of a warming climate, and if these datasets are representative of their own backyards, they will be more inclined to understand the magnitude and urgency of the climate crisis.

### [Youtube Transcript Search](https://olincollege.github.io/youtube-transcript-search/)

**If a pictureâ€™s worth a thousand words, then a YouTube video is worth *a lot*... and now you can search them!**

Have you ever been frustrated because you can't find a YouTube video you've already seen? You remember the creator, and you remember what they talked about, but you can't remember the title. Maybe it's a news channel where multiple topics are mentioned per video. Maybe it's an educational channel and you know you watched something really helpful, but you can't remember which specific video covered it. Maybe you just like data and you want to rank videos based on how many times a word/words are said.

Now you can!


## Design Nature (Fall 2021):
A first-year course at Olin, Design Nature teaches the principles of sustainability, biomimicry, and collaborative, stakeholder-driven design.

## Democracy and Media (Fall 2021):

### [Public Narrative](https://youtu.be/g4SqVDs0fMc)
A public narrative, as developed by veteran organizer and Harvard lecturer Marshall Ganz, uses storytelling as "an exercise of leadership by motivating others to join you in action on behalf of a shared purpose." Each student tells a story from their own life that illustrates a challenge they want to call you to action to address.
