## Course Projects @ Olin

### **Principles of Integrated Engineering (Fall 2022)**

PIE has a strong focus on multidisciplinary team-based projects and integrating microcontrollers into mechanical systems.

#### **[ShopNot (CNC Router)](https://olincollege.github.io/pie-2022-03/shopnot/)**

As a multidisciplinary team of 5, we built a fully functional 3-axis CNC Router in six weeks with a budget of 250 dollars.

### **Architecture and Urbanism (Fall 2022)**

Taught by professor Sara Hendren, this course explores the intersections between society and our built environment.

#### **[Op-Ed: Winter Cycling is Not an Extreme Sport](/assets/Winter_Cycling_is_Not_an_Extreme_Sport.pdf)**

For the final deliverable, we were tasked with writing an Op-Ed to make a persuasive argument about something in our built environment.

### **Materials Creation, Consumption, and Impact (Fall 2022)**

Putting a sustainability spin on Materials Science, MCCI focuses on the lifecycles and material properties of single use plastics, industrial products, and consumer goods.

#### **[Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene](/assets/MCCI/UHMWPE-poster.pdf)**

For our first MCCI project, we incorporated the materials science labs and lots of research to explore single-use plastics. Our team decided to learn about UHMWPE, specifically the rope made from this material increasingly used in commercial fishing.

#### **[Aluminum: Cast v. Wrought Alloys](/assets/MCCI/aluminum-alloys.pdf)**

For our second MCCI project, we were tasked with learning about an industrial material, including research, lab testing, and more. My group decided to explore the difference between wrought and cast aluminum alloys.

#### **[Patagonia Down Jackets](/assets/MCCI/patatonia-poster.png)**

As our 3rd project, we were tasked with diving into the materials, culture, and impact of a consumer product that is meaningful to us. My teammate and I decided to research Patagonia down jackets.

### **Quantitative Engineering Analysis 3 (Fall 2022)**

#### **[Erg Stroke Analysis](https://erganalysis.brookem.dev)**

For my final QEA 3 project, my group decided to use DFTs and frequency analysis to look deeper into the timing of the rowing stroke, specifically on an ergometer.

### **Software Design (Spring 2022)**

An computing elective at Olin, Software Design teaches the principles of various disciplines of software design and programming through the use of Python. I completed this course in Spring 2022.

#### **[Local Climate Change](https://olincollege.github.io/local-climate-change/)**

We've noticed that the vast majority of global warming and climate change information in the media centers around either record-breaking disasters or complex scientific studies inaccessible to the average citizen. We decided to visualize weather data over time, not in the Arctic or the stratosphere, but from the same local weather stations that supply your weather app the current temperature when you wake up in the morning.

We decided to dig into data collected by the ***National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)***, more specifically their ***National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)***. By looking at these historical weather datasets from a wide variety of cities around the United States, we can begin to visualize the increase in global temperatures and ever-changing global climate.

Our hypothesis is that if humans can see the data behind their anecdotal observations of a warming climate, and if these datasets are representative of their own backyards, they will be more inclined to understand the magnitude and urgency of the climate crisis.

#### **[YouTube Transcript Search](https://olincollege.github.io/youtube-transcript-search/)**

If a picture’s worth a thousand words, then a YouTube video is worth *a lot*... and now you can search them!

Have you ever been frustrated because you can't find a YouTube video you've already seen? You remember the creator, and you remember what they talked about, but you can't remember the title. Maybe it's a news channel where multiple topics are mentioned per video. Maybe it's an educational channel and you know you watched something really helpful, but you can't remember which specific video covered it. Maybe you just like data and you want to rank videos based on how many times a word/words are said.

Now you can!

### **Introduction to Sensors, Instrumentation, and Measurement (Spring 2022)**

Conducting experiments and making measurements is an essential aspect of all branches of science and engineering.  In this course we will learn the basic tools of making physical measurements and conducting experiments. We will collect data, analyze data, and design experimental systems. Using inexpensive modern sensors, we will build the necessary supporting electronics and learn to collect data with computer-based data acquisition systems.

#### **Ultrasonic Rangefinder Lab**

This lab was the 9th and final lab of the ISIM course. The assignment was to create, calibrate, and test a simple ultrasonic rangefinder, including both transmitter and receiver circuits.

### **Design Nature (Fall 2021)**

A first-year course at Olin, Design Nature teaches the principles of sustainability, biomimicry, and collaborative, stakeholder-driven design.

#### **[Bio-Inspired Hopper Project](/assets/hopper_poster.jpg)**

In the Hopper Project, students learn about the various mechanisms used by creatures that hop. Students venture out into the woods to observe hopping creatures, and then spend 7 weeks designing, prototyping, iterating, and testing simple hopping devices based on these principles. Hoppers are constructed out of a small variety of sustainable materials, and students learn about sustainable design practices during this project.

#### **[Bio-Inspired Play Project](/assets/play_project.JPG)**

In this project, students design and engineer a toy that captures the wonder of nature in a fun way – with an audience of real fourth graders from a local school as their audience.

### **Democracy and Media (Fall 2021)**

A first-year elective course at Olin, Democracy and Media teaches an understanding of democracy as something you and those around you can choose to create and practice. We ask ourselves the quintessential civic question: "What should we do?" and consider "What is my role and responsibility as a citizen? as an engineer? as a member of the Olin community?"

#### **[Public Narrative](https://youtu.be/g4SqVDs0fMc)**

A public narrative, as developed by veteran organizer and Harvard lecturer Marshall Ganz, uses storytelling as "an exercise of leadership by motivating others to join you in action on behalf of a shared purpose." Each student tells a story from their own life that illustrates a challenge they want to call you to action to address.

#### **[Designing for Democracy](https://sites.google.com/view/connectingamerica/home)**

Project Description: What deserves to be democratized? Teams will identify a design challenge where the status quo is underwhelming, such as "democratize social media" or "expand voting rights," and then look at institutions, norms and regulations, products, services, and experiences related to their challenge and imagine ways to make it more democratic / to support the growth of democracy / to support citizens to act democratically. Design challenges should be real, not imagined. You should be able to identify areas of society that would benefit from being more democratic. Using speculative design, you will create one or more ["Design Artifacts"](https://sites.google.com/view/connectingamerica/home) that realize a proposed design (a re-design of the status quo), and you will write a ["Designer Statement"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDhya4ELe1ESO2o4Pul0FkmLrVMgaVCN9HDdXxbsNXI/edit?usp=sharing) that explains what you did and why.
